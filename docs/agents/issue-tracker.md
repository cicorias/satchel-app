# Issue tracker: Local Markdown

Work items for this repo live as markdown files in `.scratch/`, **committed to the repo** (ADR-0018). GitHub Issues on `cicorias/satchel-app` stay open for public bug reports and support only. They are not the work queue.

## Conventions

- One feature (or phase) per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`
- The spec is `.scratch/<feature-slug>/spec.md`. It's short and points into `docs/spec.md` instead of repeating it.
- Implementation issues are one file per ticket at `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`. Never use a single combined tickets file.
- Each issue file has these header lines near the top:
  - `Status:` one of `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `claimed`, `resolved`, `wontfix`
  - `Type:` one of `task`, `research`, `prototype`, `grilling`
  - `Blocked by:` ticket numbers in the same feature (`NN, NN`), a relative path for a ticket in another feature (`../../<feature>/issues/NN-slug.md`), or `-` if nothing blocks it
- `ready-for-human` means a step that needs your accounts, judgment, or hands (Apple portal, store consoles, legal review).
- Comments and conversation history append to the bottom of the file under a `## Comments` heading.
- Commit ticket changes together with the work they describe. Use the ticket path in the commit body (e.g. `Refs .scratch/phase-1-capture-engine/issues/05-metadata-resolver.md`).

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a new file under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/` (creating the directory if needed).

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read the file at the referenced path. The user will normally pass the path or the issue number directly.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a file with one **child** file per ticket.

- **Map**: `.scratch/<effort>/map.md` (the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body).
- **Child ticket**: `.scratch/<effort>/issues/NN-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, with the question in the body. A `Type:` line records the ticket type (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`); a `Status:` line records `claimed`/`resolved`.
- **Blocking**: a `Blocked by: NN, NN` line near the top. A ticket is unblocked when every file it lists is `resolved`.
- **Frontier**: scan `.scratch/<effort>/issues/` for files that are open, unblocked, and unclaimed; first by number wins.
- **Claim**: set `Status: claimed` and save before any work.
- **Resolve**: append the answer under an `## Answer` heading, set `Status: resolved`, then append a context pointer (gist + link) to the map's Decisions-so-far in `map.md`.
